            be used to challenge you. Bonus levels are weird and are made to be very hard to understand. Bonus levels are also levels
            that need to be unlocked first, the bonus level will not show up until a certain level in beaten.</p>

            <p>On some levels there will be hidden links, these hidden links may send you to new levels that aren't accessable through
            the home page. There may be more that these hidden links will do. Think of these as hidden rooms that you find in games.
