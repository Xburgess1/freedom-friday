            <h3>What You Need To Know</h3>
            <p>
                In this game there are certain topics that may be unfamiliar to some people. Here are some topics you may want to know before diving in.
                <ul>
                    <li>Binary - Binary are a series of 1s and 0s, together they look something like this - 110100110. They are not always in this order,
                    the 1s and 0s can be in any order. You can look up a binary converter, once you have a binary converter, convert the binary into 
                    decimal. 110100110 translates into 422.</li>
                    <li>Hexadecimal - Hexadecimal use 16 different characters to display numbers. The characters they use are 0-9 and A-F. Hexadecimal 
                    would look something like this - B69. The 16 characters can be in any order. You can look up a hexadecimal converter, once you have
                    found one you can convert the hexadecimal into decimal. B69 translates into 2921.</li>
                    <li>Morse Code - Morse Code is a character encoding scheme. Morse code is made up of dots and dashes or dits and dahs. Morse code will
                    look something like this: ---.. .----, these dots and dashes can be in any order. The space represents the different characters. You
                    can look up a Morse Code translator to translate the Morse Code into proper words and numbers. ---.. .---- translates to 81.</li>
