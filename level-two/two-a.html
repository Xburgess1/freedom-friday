                    This level shows the use of different paths to complete puzzles. There are two different pages that you are able to go to. One will lead
                    to a page with input box on it, the other will only give clues. Both webpages are needed to solve the puzzle, part of the answer is on
                    one page the other part of the answer is on the other page.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="text" id="box2">
                <p id="text1">
                    You may have to jump between the two pages when solving the puzzle. To make this easier you can go to one page, copy the link and paste it
                    in a new tab. Then open the second page on the orginal tab, this will save you time and frustration.
